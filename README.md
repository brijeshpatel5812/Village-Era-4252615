# **Project Title**

**Village Era**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Problem Statement / Abstract**

In many rural areas, villagers face challenges in communicating their
complaints, needs, and suggestions to the Sarpanch due to a lack of
proper communication systems. This often leads to delays in resolving
issues and hinders village development.\
**Village Era** aims to solve this problem by providing a digital
platform that connects villagers and local authorities. Built using
**Java**, **Lottie**, and **TensorFlow Lite**, the app allows villagers
to post complaints or suggestions while enabling the Sarpanch to view,
respond, and issue notices efficiently.\
The app also integrates **AI-powered features** like **speech-to-text
conversion** and **sentiment analysis**, helping prioritize urgent
complaints and improving accessibility in rural areas. By digitizing
local governance, Village Era encourages transparency, participation,
and smarter communication within rural communities.

## **Goals / Requirements**

-   Enable villagers to submit complaints, feedback, or suggestions
    easily.\
-   Allow the Sarpanch to receive, review, and respond to complaints
    efficiently.\
-   Implement AI features (speech-to-text, sentiment analysis) to assist
    users and improve response handling.\
-   Provide offline support so users can record data even without
    internet connectivity.\
-   Build a simple, user-friendly interface accessible to rural
    populations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Tech Stack**

-   **Frontend:** Java (Android Studio), Lottie\
-   **Backend:** Firebase (Database & Authentication)\
-   **AI/ML:** TensorFlow Lite (for speech-to-text and sentiment
    analysis)
