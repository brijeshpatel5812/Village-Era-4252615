In many rural areas, villagers face challenges in communicating their complaints, needs, and suggestions to the Sarpanch due to a lack of proper communication systems. This often leads to delays in resolving issues and hinders village development. Village Era aims to solve this problem by providing a digital platform that connects villagers and local authorities. Built using Java, Lottie, and TensorFlow Lite, the app allows villagers to post complaints or suggestions while enabling the Sarpanch to view, respond, and issue notices efficiently. The integration of TensorFlow Lite enhances the app’s intelligence and usability. The expected outcome of this project is a user-friendly mobile application that improves transparency, encourages participation, and strengthens communication between villagers and the Sarpanch. By digitizing local governance, Village Era contributes to building smarter and more connected rural communities.# Village-Era-4252615
